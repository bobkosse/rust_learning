# My RUST Learning Journey

My name is Bob Kosse and I like to do 'technical' things like software development. Recently I discovered that there was a language called Rust that performs just as well as C and C++, but in a more modern approach.

I come from a web development background and always felt like I wanted to learn a more low-level language. Rust is the language I'm playing with now.

I'm just following the book [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) and trying to add some extra functionality here and there to get comfortable with this development language.

Tips, tricks and feedback on this 'work' are of course appreciated!
